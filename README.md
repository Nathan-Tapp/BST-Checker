# BST-Checker
Binary Search Tree project.
# Description:
This file contains the declaration of the BSTChecker class, which provides functionality
to check the validity of a binary search tree (BST). The BSTChecker class offers a static
method CheckBSTValidity, which takes the root node of a BST as input and returns a pointer
to the first node that violates the BST property, or nullptr if the BST is valid.

# Input:
The CheckBSTValidity method expects a pointer to the root node of the binary search tree
as input.

# Output:
If the binary search tree is valid, the CheckBSTValidity method returns nullptr. Otherwise,
it returns a pointer to the first node that violates the BST property.
